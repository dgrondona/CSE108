Went over the syllabus for the first bit of class, then went into review on the basics of Python.

## Python

Python is a very popular language, mostly because it is simple, the syntax is basic, but it is still pretty powerful.
- popular high-level language with simple and easy to read syntax
- common uses
    - data processing
    - backend development
- characteristics
    - interpreted
    - object-oriented
    - dynamically typed (type is not specified)
    - garbage collected (cleans heap automatically)

### Python History

- created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 as Python 0.9.0
- python 2.0 was released in 2000
- python 3.0 was released in 2008
    - not completely backwards compatible with Python 2
    - many developers continued with Python 2.x for years
    - Python 2.0 finally discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020
    - Python 3.0 is the preferred version now

### Python Hello World

```python
print("Hello World")
```

Very simple.

### Getting started with Python

- Download and install from Python.org for Windows, Linux, or Mac
- Recommended IDE's
    - Pycharm
        - pro version is free for students
    - VS Code
- Online options
    - Replit.com
        - doesn't work great for this anymore
    - PythonAnywhere.com
    - online-python.com

### Variables and Types

- python is completely object oriented
- every variable in python is an object
- not statically typed
    - no need to declare variables

#### Integers

```python
myint = 7
print(myint)
```

#### Strings

```python
mystring = "Hello World"
print(mystring)
```

- can use single or double quotes
- new line (\n)
- operators

In python you can assign values to multiple variables at once and ask the type using the type() function.

#### Casting

need to cast to make this work:
```python
one = 1
two = 2
hello = "hello"
print (str(one + two) + hello)
```

you cannot do this:
```python
print(str('abc'))
```

#### Lists

- ordered set of items, accessed by an index
- a list is more like an array or vector in C++ or Java

```python
things = [1, 3, 6, 7]
print(things[0])

= 1
```

you can also index negative numbers:
```python
things = [1, 3, 6, 7]
print(things[-1])

= 7
```

- you can put multiple different types in a list:
```python
things = [1, "ron", 6.3, True, [1, 2, 3]]
print(things[-1][1])

= 2
```

- lists are mutable - you can chage the contents after its creation
- lists are stored as dynamic arrays in memory (not linked list)
    - arrays are more efficient than linked lists
    - arrays are not as efficient at appending

appending to a list:
```python
mylist = []

mylist.append(10)
mylist.append(20)
mylist.append(30)

= [10, 20, 30]
```

- common methods
    - append()
    - clear()
    - count()
    - extend()
    instert()
    - reverse()
    - sort()

### Basic Operations

- \+  add
- \-  subtract
- \*  multiply
- \/  divide

You can also do operations on strings:
```python
string = "hello"
print(string * 10)

= hellohellohellohellohellohellohellohello...
```

These operations also work on lists.

### Conditions

- Python uses boolean logic to evaluate conditions
- the "and" and "or" boolean operators allow building complex boolean expressions

```python
name = "John"
age = 23

if name == "John" and age == 23:
    pring("Your name is John. You are 23 years old.")

if name == "John" or name == "Rick":
    print("Your name is either John or Rick")
```

- the 'in' operator an be used to check if a specified object exists within a list
- Else if statements (elif) let you have as any conditions as you like
- the 'is' operator is not quite the same as the == sign

```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [1, 2, 3]

print(x == y)
print(x is y)

= True
False
```

```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = x

print(x == y)
print(x is y)

= True
True
```
In this case, y is a reference to x and shares the same memory, so the is condition would be true.
