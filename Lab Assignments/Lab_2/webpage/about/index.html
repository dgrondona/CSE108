        <p>
            Artisan, born in 1762, was one of the 97 founders of this fine establishment. He was 4'3" and could speak fluently in lithuanian.
            Artisan continues his work to this day, developing state-of-the-art sea mines for the everyday citizen. He enjoys watching late night talk shows
            on the television and eating hamburgers.

         <p>
            Bits joined the company in 1914, around the time Chrisopher Columbus was born. As a retired mobster, Bits enjoys playing the harp and playing the hit
            game "Dance Dance Revolution". Bits brought many innovations to the company including a snack bar and weekends off. Though he sadly passed away in
            1908, we celebrate him on National Bits Day every year.
